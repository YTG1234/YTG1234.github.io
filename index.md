Hello, I am YTG123. I do some programming in my free time.

## Things I like to do
* Code in Java and Kotlin
* Mod [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/)
	* I like using [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/) to do so
		* Modularity
		* Separation of Concerns
		* Nice people develop it
		* Supportive Discord server
	* I don't like MCP mappings
	* I don't like Spigot mappings
	* I respect [MinecraftForge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge) as a project, but don't like its [lead](https://github.com/LexManos).
* I also read books
* And watch YouTube videos.
